# EspNow-MoistureSensor

This is a simple ESP-Now project, where moisture and battery levels are measured and sent to an ESP-Now receiver (hub). The ESP-Now data is in JSON format.

I myself used an ESP8266 (d1 mini).

This project has been built with battery power in mind.


The code for the receiver has been uploaded to another repo.
